# Higher or Lower
A game (originally made in Python) remastered to a JavaScript game.

### Rules
A pretty simple game; there are two rounds: Higher rounds and Lower rounds. During Higher rounds, your goal is to play the higher value card. In a lower round, you would attempt to play the lower value card.

The catch: you don't know what the next card is that you're going to get; neither will you know your opponent's card.

### Credits
I did everything, but props to Nathan for the inspiration.
